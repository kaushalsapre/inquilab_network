# inquilab_network

This is the OS image for the server+router setup Inquilab_Network from 29/2/2020. To be used with a Raspberry Pi. 

Inquilab Network is a portable WiFi based local area network that can be used to host and share data without connecting to the internet. 

It is a customized copy of the Mazizone project (http://www.mazizone.eu/). To edit it further, go through its documentation here - https://github.com/mazi-project/guides/wiki

To install, burn the .img file on an SD card (min 16GB) and insert it into a single board computer (tested with RPi 3, 3B and Odroid XU4) and boot. Look for a WiFi with ssid IQUILAB_NETWORK and connect. If the splashscreen doesn't redirect you, open chrome and go to http://inq.net)
